    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The topic of bad &amp;ldquo;allies&amp;rdquo; has come up a lot lately. Some people want to know how to identify bad allies.
Others want to know if they are being bad allies. Below is a list of common issues in the ever popular
internet quiz style to help you determine if yourself or someone else might be a bad ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not about any one specific person. It is a collection of issues myself and others
have seen repeatedly from people claiming to be allies. If you take this personally or think
it&amp;rsquo;s about you, you might just be a bad ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So come one, come all, and take the bad ally quiz! The points are mostly made up, but they sure do matter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="quiz"&gt;Quiz&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give yourself points for each item that applies, even if it only applies sometimes. Items without a specified value are worth 1 point. For points assigned &amp;ldquo;per incident,&amp;rdquo; count all incidents from the last year. Be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="words"&gt;Words&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you spend a lot of time telling people what a &amp;ldquo;good ally&amp;rdquo; you are?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you claim that you never make mistakes or act in an oppressive way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you complain about spaces that only allow members of an oppressed group because you cannot be involved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you use patronizing language (e.g. referring to an adult as a child) when speaking with or about people in the group you are allied to? &lt;em&gt;(20 points per incident)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you use slurs when speaking with or about people in the group you are allied to? &lt;em&gt;(1000 points per incident)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="interactions-with-the-people-you-are-allied-with"&gt;Interactions with the people you are allied with&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you demand that people educate you (instead of seeking to educate yourself)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you demand they give you time or attention (e.g. expecting advice on demand, requesting they give you personalized reviews of articles)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you tell them to fix a specific issue because they are part of a group (e.g. demanding they speak at a conference, insisting they write a post on a specific topic)? &lt;em&gt;(10 points per incident)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you tell them how to speak or behave?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you &lt;a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Tone_argument"&gt;tone police&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. telling them to be nicer, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ll catch more flies with honey&amp;rdquo;)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you &lt;a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Concern_troll"&gt;concern troll&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you accuse people of overreacting, being too sensitive, or blowing things out of proportion?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you only ally yourself with members of the group who fit your idea of a &amp;ldquo;model minority&amp;rdquo; (look, act, and/or behave a certain way) or who agree with you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you treat the group like a monolith (i.e. assume they all think and act the same way and want the same things)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you dismiss their personal experiences?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you tell them what tactics to use when fighting oppression?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you use other members of the group to validate your behavior (e.g. I have a black friend, I&amp;rsquo;m married to a woman)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you demand praise or acknowledgment of your allyship or specific acts as an ally?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you tend to dominate conversations instead of letting others speak?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you play &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.shakesville.com/2013/10/liss-says-stuff-3-devils-advocate.html"&gt;devil&amp;rsquo;s advocate&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; when discussing issues important to them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you ask people about sensitive issues (e.g. assault, genitalia, sexuality)? &lt;em&gt;(10 points)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you push or disrespect their boundaries (e.g. continuing a conversation when asked to stop, touching someone without permission)? &lt;em&gt;(30 points per incident)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have members of the group you are allied with called you a bad ally or said you were not an ally at all? &lt;em&gt;(100 points per incident)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="making-mistakes"&gt;Making mistakes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you mentioned your status as an ally when called out on mistakes or bad behavior? &lt;em&gt;(5 points per incident)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you try to play off mistakes as a joke? &lt;em&gt;(10 points)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you act defensively when called out on mistakes or bad behavior? &lt;em&gt;(5 points)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you get angry and lash out when called out on mistakes or bad behavior? &lt;em&gt;(20 points per incident)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you make the same mistakes over and over again? &lt;em&gt;(10 points)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you fail to evaluate and understand your privilege?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you laugh at jokes at the expense of the group you are allied with?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you make jokes at the expense of the group you are allied with? &lt;em&gt;(10 points)&lt;/em&gt; Frequently? &lt;em&gt;(100 points)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you sit quietly by when others say or do things that harm the group you are allied with?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you only a fair weather ally (i.e. you only help when things are easy or benefit you)? &lt;em&gt;(20 points)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you only call out bad behavior when someone is around to see it and provide you with praise for doing so?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you spend more time speaking for an oppressed group than listening to them or promoting their words?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you frequently speak/write/present about the oppressed group without first suggesting that a program/publication/event/etc. speak to members of that group instead? &lt;em&gt;(10 points per incident)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you take credit for the work of members of the group you are allied with? &lt;em&gt;(10 points per incident)&lt;/em&gt; Without also giving them credit? &lt;em&gt;(100 points per incident)&lt;/em&gt; While claiming they did not do the work? &lt;em&gt;(1000 points per incident)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you do things that actively harm members of the group you are allied with? &lt;em&gt;(100 points per incident)&lt;/em&gt; Intentionally? &lt;em&gt;(1000 points per incident)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="scoring"&gt;Scoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The higher your score, the less frequently you act as a good ally. Higher scores indicate you are probably
not an ally at all. Below are some arbitrary scoring breakdowns I came up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0-1:&lt;/strong&gt; Either you&amp;rsquo;re an amazingly awesome ally or you lied on the quiz. The latter seems more likely &amp;ndash; shame on you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2-10:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re doing a pretty good job, but remember that being an ally is an &lt;a href="http://www.shakesville.com/2013/04/on-fixed-state-ally-model-vs-process.html"&gt;ongoing process&lt;/a&gt;, so you should continue to work hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11-24:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re making some mistakes and have room for improvement, but you are making good progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25-49:&lt;/strong&gt; You make a lot of mistakes, but might still act as an ally at times. You have a lot of room to improve. You should spend more time &lt;a href="/blog/2013/11/02/101-off-limits/"&gt;educating yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50-99:&lt;/strong&gt; You are rarely or never an ally, but might be able to start developing your skills if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to work hard. You need to spend a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time on &lt;a href="/blog/2013/11/02/101-off-limits/"&gt;educating yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100+:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re not ready to be an ally. Stop claiming you are. &lt;a href="/blog/2013/11/02/101-off-limits/"&gt;Go educate yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1000+:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re not even close to being an ally. In fact, you&amp;rsquo;re probably actively harming members of the group you&amp;rsquo;re supposedly allied with. STOP IT. Work on improving asap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5000+:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re not an ally. You&amp;rsquo;re a shitty human being. What the fuck is wrong with you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Blast from the Past: Interviewing Women Candidates</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, a coworker who understands my enjoyment at rage humor brought me a special present from the past &amp;ndash; a pamphlet titled &amp;ldquo;Interviewing Women Candidates&amp;rdquo; created by the U.S. Civil Service Commission in 1974.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is equal parts hilarious and horrifying how much of this still seems necessary and relevant 40 years later. I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to create a slightly modernized version and start handing copies out at tech events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="pamphlet_page1.png"&gt;&lt;img src="pamphlet_page1.png" alt="pamphlet page 1" width="23%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="pamphlet_page2.png"&gt;&lt;img src="pamphlet_page2.png" alt="pamphlet page 2" width="23%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="pamphlet_page3.png"&gt;&lt;img src="pamphlet_page3.png" alt="pamphlet page 3" width="23%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="pamphlet_page4.png"&gt;&lt;img src="pamphlet_page4.png" alt="pamphlet page 4" width="23%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to know, sometimes, how to act with someone of another race, another generation, the other sex. What may have been the norm yesterday isn&amp;rsquo;t accepted today and may not be tolerated tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewing women as candidates or potential applicants is one situation for which the norms are changing. Here are some rules to go by. They are not intended to establish that any specific behavior is legal or illegal, contrary to Federal regulations or not. The perspective is one of the common sense, common courtesy and a professional approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a supervisor filling a vacant position, or as a representative of your agency interviewing potential applicants, you want to do the right thing, to make a favorable impression for your organization and to avoid embarrassment for yourself and the people you interview. This is an attempt to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the right words. Try to remember that the women in your office are not &amp;ldquo;girls&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;gals.&amp;rdquo; And the woman you&amp;rsquo;re interviewing isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;sweetie&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;honey&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;dear&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; even if you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a good ol&amp;#39; boy, even if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; call men you&amp;rsquo;ve never met before things like &amp;ldquo;pal&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;chum.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we please stop arguing about &lt;a href="http://www.lilliechilen.com/woman/"&gt;calling women girls&lt;/a&gt; now that you realize how long this has been considered inappropriate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t inquire into certain areas that are none of our business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Her marital status (or nonmarital arrangements) or plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What her husband does, how he feels about her working, traveling, or anything else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether she has any children (or plans to) and how many, what ages or sex they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrangements for the care of her children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Her views on birth control, abortion, women&amp;rsquo;s lib.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t bring up your prejudices. You&amp;rsquo;re entitled to them, of course, but you aren&amp;rsquo;t entitled to do anything about them on company time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Women shouldn&amp;rsquo;t travel alone, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t travel with men, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t stay overnight in another city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Women aren&amp;rsquo;t aggressive enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are too emotional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They never stick with a job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They won&amp;rsquo;t accept travel assignments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That women want to work only until marriage, or that they all want to marry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That women are absent from work more than men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That they use more sick leave than men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Women don&amp;rsquo;t want responsibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t supervise men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t supervise women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in certain fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aren&amp;rsquo;t mobile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous how many of these prejudices (and that is exactly what they are) still exist today. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a number of these in person and probably seen all of them on Hacker News. I would be thrilled if I never again have someone tell me that women aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in programming because biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t flirt, don&amp;rsquo;t be patronizing (&amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ll find lots of boyfriends&amp;rdquo;). Don&amp;rsquo;t presume: Interviewers sometimes take advantage of an interviewee&amp;rsquo;s friendliness to act as if there is a degree of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard stories from several friends who had this happen in job interviews within the last year or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t joke. Some men find it embarrassing to behave toward women in a completely businesslike way. It can bring on the same kind of feelings you had as a child when you were trying to lie and thought the smirk you were suppressing must be obvious to everyone. The fact is that when women are treated as adult human beings, they don&amp;rsquo;t notice anything strange about it &amp;ndash; or you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. Let me repeat that. &lt;strong&gt;When women are treated as adult human beings, they don&amp;rsquo;t notice anything strange about it.&lt;/strong&gt; How ridiculous is it that people have to be told that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, in making a selection or recommendation, it is improper to give consideration to such factors as the following:
- That supervisors or managers might prefer men.
- Customers/clients wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with women.
- Coworkers might object.
- Women&amp;rsquo;s work lacks credibility.
- The job involves travel, or travel with the opposite sex.
- It involves unusual working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interviewing &amp;ndash; say, on campus &amp;ndash; it is your responsibility as a Federal representative to assure that candidates are scheduled impartially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is improper to place undue emphasis on conditions of employment in the hope of discouraging the candidate, i.e., to solicit a declination. It is for the applicant, not the employer, to decide whether or not she wants the job &amp;ndash; based, of course, on a clear explanation of what the conditions are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, don&amp;rsquo;t indicate your interest in a woman candidate as one whose selection would help improve your EEO picture (it&amp;rsquo;s an insulting suggestion that you&amp;rsquo;d apply different standards).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of men telling women they were hired as tokens. This still happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general rule is that one should treat women applicants and men applicants in the same way. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it right if you also go through the motions of asking men, say, about their prospects for parenthood: The point is that in most cases men have no reason to suppose that an improper significance would be attached to the answer, whereas women do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discriminatory behavior is as improper when it is not intended as when it is, and the appearance can be as important as the reality. That you ask certain questions not related to the job wouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily show that you mean to discriminate, but such questions can be used and have been used in a discriminatory way, and women are increasingly aware of and resentful of this. The fact that certain questions are not relevant to consideration for employment is why they are improper when introduced into an employment interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, even in 1974, they knew that intent wasn&amp;rsquo;t as important as outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;ts&lt;/em&gt;. Where, you may ask, are the &lt;em&gt;do&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt;? What &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; you talk about? Simple: There&amp;rsquo;s the job, its duties and responsibilities. The organization, its missions, programs and achievements. Career possibilities and opportunities for growth, development, advancement. Where the job is located, travel, mobility, equipment and facilities available (especially important with scientists). The individual&amp;rsquo;s qualifications: abilities, experience, education, interests. The wonder is that one can cover all the ground that needs to be covered, let alone have any time left for irrelevancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh hey, there&amp;rsquo;s so many useful and interesting things to talk to ladies about. Why are you being an asshole again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last rule, though. Don&amp;rsquo;t go the other way: Don&amp;rsquo;t take pains to point out how fair-minded you and your organization are (it will sound phony anyway) or give an instant replay of every female success story. And don&amp;rsquo;t make a big deal about being mature: If you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go along with &amp;ldquo;Ms.&amp;rdquo; and avoid masculine pronouns when you mean man or woman, that&amp;rsquo;s fine but at least don&amp;rsquo;t put it in italics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see this come up a lot from people and organizations who are responsible for poor behavior. Instead of owning it and apologizing, they focus on all the other things they did that supposedly make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This guide was written with an awareness that many supervisors and agency representatives are men. While some of the points here obviously apply only to them, most would be applicable regardless of the interviewer&amp;rsquo;s sex.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>On Making Mistakes</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The topic of making mistakes and apologizing is pretty well tread ground, but I wanted to collect my own thoughts on the matter and figured it couldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to share. The usual disclaimers about this being my opinion and your mileage may vary apply. Also I say &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; quite a bit. So, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about making mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistakes are complicated and have many variables. I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how to handle every specific situation. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve found the following rough steps to be a very useful outline in navigating my own missteps. I recommend considering them and giving them a try. Making mistakes well is an important skill, and you should work on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="expectations"&gt;Expectations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step one&lt;/strong&gt; of making mistakes is realizing that you&amp;rsquo;re going to make them&amp;hellip;a lot. We all fuck up. Every last one of us. You fuck up. I fuck up. Everyone fucks up. Nobody is immune from making mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="you-fucked-up"&gt;You fucked up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step two&lt;/strong&gt; is actually making a mistake. Nobody really &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; help with this part. We manage to do a pretty good job of it all on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step three&lt;/strong&gt; is finding out you made a mistake. Maybe you realize the mistake yourself. Maybe a friend points it out kindly. Maybe someone you hurt tells you that you royally fucked up. Maybe someone who is frustrated yells at you and is nasty about it. Or one of a hundred other flavors of learning you have done something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="processing"&gt;Processing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step four&lt;/strong&gt; is coming to terms with making a mistake. This part can be hard and painful and nasty. I recommend handling this step as privately as possible to avoid putting the nasty parts on display, which often leads to even more mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very common initial reaction is to be defensive. You probably didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; to make a mistake or cause harm. Unfortunately, you did whether you meant to or not. It&amp;rsquo;s ok to feel defensive &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly human response. However, it&amp;rsquo;s usually one you want to keep to yourself (and maybe a few close friends). Responding defensively is an intentional act that defends your mistake instead of admitting fault. It can do additional harm and is unlikely to improve the situation. Take a little time to sit with any feelings of defensiveness. They will likely pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the mistake was pointed out by someone else, a common reaction is to be frustrated or angry with them. The previous advice about defensiveness stands. I recommend looking at what they did as an act of kindness, even if presented in a hostile way. Mistakes can make you look bad and follow you for a long time when not resolved. Thanks to that person, you know what you did wrong and have a chance to make amends. The person who pointed it out isn&amp;rsquo;t the problem &amp;ndash; your mistake is. It can be difficult to deal with anger, frustration, or hostility, but mistakes have consequences, and they&amp;rsquo;re not always easy. People who have been hurt aren&amp;rsquo;t always nice, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the fact that you made a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common feeling is remorse. To feel shame or disappointment in yourself. This is understandable, especially if your mistake caused harm. You may be sad, but remember that your sadness isn&amp;rsquo;t as immediately important as fixing the mistake nor is it a replacement for making amends. Once you&amp;rsquo;re done, you can take as much time as you feel appropriate to beat yourself up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handle a mistake well, and you can actually come out with more respect than when you started. On the flip side, responding poorly makes you look even worse than the initial mistake. Choose wisely. There are no do-overs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="atonement"&gt;Atonement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step five&lt;/strong&gt; is taking steps to make amends for your mistake. This will vary a lot depending on what you did and who you harmed. I can&amp;rsquo;t give you an exact script, but I find the following steps to be pretty useful and effective in a lot of situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly identify and articulate what you did wrong and any harm that it caused. Avoid (or if you feel compelled to bring it up, dramatically minimize) discussion of what you intended. Good intent is certainly better than bad, but your good intentions don&amp;rsquo;t make up for a harmful outcome. Mentioning your intent often is seen as making excuses, detracts from the quality of an apology, and makes you seem less sincere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologize for the harm you caused. &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;apologize&amp;rdquo; for someone else being offended, include caveats, or use any wording that puts the fault on anyone besides yourself. &lt;em&gt;Your&lt;/em&gt; actions caused the harm. Own that if you&amp;rsquo;re going to apologize. A &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-apology_apology"&gt;faux apology&lt;/a&gt; is often worse than no apology at all. Keep it simple. Something like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry I did X&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I apologize for hurting Y&amp;rdquo; often works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask if there is anything you can do to make amends for the harm caused. Listen carefully. If possible, do what is asked of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id="progress"&gt;Progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step six&lt;/strong&gt; is making progress. Unless you&amp;rsquo;ve done something exceptionally horrible, you get to move on from mistakes. However, moving on should not mean forgetting and thus dooming yourself to repeat your mistakes. Analyze what you did wrong and try your best to avoid a repeat. This may include additional self-education or work on your part. It&amp;rsquo;s totally worth it to not hurt someone and go through all this again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone else is writing one of these end of the year blog posts, so I suppose I will jump on that bandwagon too. I&amp;rsquo;m lazy, so I&amp;rsquo;m going with a list. Here&amp;rsquo;s some of the stuff I did this year in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started a new job at Google.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued as the chapter leader of &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-IT-Pittsburgh/"&gt;Girl Develop It Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; and taught two classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gave my first conference talk (and then two more after that).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended 6 conferences in 5 different cities. &lt;a href="/speaking"&gt;Spoke&lt;/a&gt; at three of them. Helped organize &lt;a href="http://steelcityruby.org/"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;. This was probably too much, but it was awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went to &lt;a href="http://gracehopper.org/"&gt;Grace Hopper Celebration&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite like being in a room with 4,000 other women programmers. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never been, you should go at least once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started a speaker support group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read (and &lt;a href="/blog/2013/04/03/julie-s-lean-in-livetweets/"&gt;livetweeted&lt;/a&gt;) Lean In. I&amp;rsquo;m still angry about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started assuaging my corporate guilt by donating to awesome people on &lt;a href="https://www.gittip.com/"&gt;Gittip&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you to the folks who donated to me!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got scared (see: pycon 2013), and I got loud because silence is too high a price for my safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrote about &lt;a href="/blog/2013/03/24/my-experiences-in-tech-death-by-1000-paper-cuts/"&gt;death by 1000 papercuts&lt;/a&gt; because it was important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/2013/11/10/site-redesign-using-middleman/"&gt;Redesigned my site&lt;/a&gt; and tried to write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created a &lt;a href="/blog/2013/11/02/101-off-limits/"&gt;101 off limits&lt;/a&gt; list because I wanted to educate without exhausting myself. What can I say, I&amp;rsquo;m a coder, I like to keep things DRY.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thought a lot about mental health. I went on medication for the first time in 28 years for my anxiety. I saw &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/72690223"&gt;Greg Bauges&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_ku2YmnWkA"&gt;Ed Finkler&lt;/a&gt; speak candidly about their own experiences with mental health issues (if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen their talks, go watch them now).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;a href="/blog/2013/11/02/it-s-dangerous-to-go-alone-battling-the-invisible-monsters-in-tech/"&gt;spoke about impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt; as an important mental health issue. I  started an &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/battling-the-invisible-monsters"&gt;online support group&lt;/a&gt; and hope to continue talking about this in 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spoiled the crap out of my cats and took approximately a billion photos of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I internalized and started really working on something I&amp;rsquo;ve known, but had difficulty with in the past: setting and maintaining boundaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ran out of fucks to give about people who are harmful and don&amp;rsquo;t respect boundaries. I burned some bridges it was no longer worth maintaining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And last, but definitely not least, I made some awesome new friendships and strengthened others. Much love for all of you. &amp;lt;3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still working on figuring things out. What I want to do with myself. Finding my voice. This was a rough year, but I pushed myself to do a lot of scary things that were important to me and met some amazing people as a result. I consider it a net positive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On Twitter</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I use twitter quite a lot, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to explain why and how I use it. I think this is becoming increasingly necessary as I get more followers. They follow for a wide variety of reasons and some context may help minimize confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is a long post. New followers should at least read the &lt;a href="#how-to-engage-with-me"&gt;How to Engage with Me&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-twitter?"&gt;Why Twitter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a little history. I created a twitter account in 2008. I tried to use it a few times, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a sense of why twitter was useful. It was a lot of noise with no signal to be found. A few years ago, I tried again. That time I found the signal that made it worth braving the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, twitter has enabled me to meet people all over the world with similar interests, passions, and values. People who have helped me learn and expand my worldview. People who support me and challenge me. People who I now consider friends &amp;ndash; yes, one can develop and maintain meaningful friendships over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot adequately use words to describe how valuable this has been to me, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try. It may be a surprise to some people, but I used to be a very quiet, passive person who rarely socialized or spoke up. The short answer for why is a combination of isolation and social anxiety. The friends I made on twitter helped immensely with both. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to feel isolated when you have friends all over the world willing to support you, who care about you. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s easier to start finding your voice in text when you have social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went to conferences in other cities, suddenly I had friends to look forward to hanging out with. When one of us had a rough day, people were at the ready to jump on a hangout to provide support. Girl Develop It Pittsburgh found the initial volunteers it needed on twitter. People on twitter provided me with the encouragement, support, and resources to start &lt;a href="/blog/2013/11/02/it-s-dangerous-to-go-alone-battling-the-invisible-monsters-in-tech/"&gt;speaking about impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter helped me meet people who I now consider very close friends. Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s about the people, but the tool helped me find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-i-use-twitter"&gt;How I Use Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous section, I talked a little bit about using twitter as a tool to meet people and a tool for overcoming social anxiety. These were the initial ways I used twitter, but I have expanded to using this tool for so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="uses"&gt;Uses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use twitter as a tool for &lt;strong&gt;activism&lt;/strong&gt;. I might be trying to use it to raise awareness about a specific issue or calling attention to some harmful behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime I use twitter as a tool for &lt;strong&gt;education&lt;/strong&gt;. I will spend time having difficult conversations and trying to teach an audience of one or many about a specific subject. Topics I tend to educate on include: feminism, diversity in tech, intersectionality, and impostor syndrome. I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert on any of these topics, but I know more than some, so I try to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use twitter to &lt;strong&gt;socialize&lt;/strong&gt;. I have a lot of friends on there in differing time zones, and it is often the most convenient place for us to joke, share, and chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use twitter for &lt;strong&gt;humor&lt;/strong&gt; and silliness. Contrary to popular belief, feminists do have a sense of humor. My humor tends to be sarcastic, absurd, or involve A LOT OF SHOUTING!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use twitter to &lt;strong&gt;vent&lt;/strong&gt;. All of that activism and educating is hard, and it takes its toll. Venting is necessary to let off steam and regroup, so I can keep on keeping on. Sometimes I vent with friends because they need to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use twitter to post pictures of my &lt;strong&gt;cats&lt;/strong&gt; or random information about them. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much the cat mom equivalent of that person who won&amp;rsquo;t stop telling you about all the stuff their baby does (see example below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juliepagano/status/389919899310886912/photo/1"&gt;
  &lt;img src="kitties.jpg" alt="kitties" width="320"
       style="border-radius: 30px"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I use twitter to livetweet &lt;strong&gt;movies&lt;/strong&gt; for fun. I created a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jurimovietweets"&gt;separate account&lt;/a&gt; for that because it&amp;rsquo;s a LOT of tweeting, and I am ok with separating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switch between all of the above types of tweeting with a fair amount of frequency. My impression is the context switches are fairly obvious to people who have followed me for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tagging"&gt;Tagging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to hashtag certain content, so it is easy for people to mute. I usually hashtag conference tweeting for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to remember to tag certain content because it&amp;rsquo;s triggering for followers, and they want to mute it. I try to trigger warn certain content or sections of tweets when I can. For a while, I trigger warned my entire account because I was doing activism about sexual assault and rape culture. I&amp;rsquo;m not perfect in any of this, and the 140 character limit sometimes makes it difficult, but I try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I regularly hit on a topic that&amp;rsquo;s triggering for you, please feel free to let me know. I make no promises that I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to stop or tag it for you, but I will see if we can make something work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="posting-articles-and-retweeting"&gt;Posting Articles and Retweeting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often post articles or retweet content that I find interesting or worthy of discussion. Unless I specfically say so, I do not intend for this to indicate full agreement with or endorsement of all content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="following"&gt;Following&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I follow a reasonable number of people, but I only regularly read a few. I heavily use lists. If I stop being interested in your feed, I may unfollow you. An unfollow is not an indication of my thoughts on you as a person &amp;ndash; it just means your feed wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good fit for me. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to clean up my follows and keep things as lean as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="blocking"&gt;Blocking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I block people fairly easily. Twitter is a space where I choose to engage with people who increase the value of the experience for me. If you don&amp;rsquo;t respect my boundaries or the boundaries of my friends, I may block you. If you&amp;rsquo;re an asshole, I may block you. If you regularly say racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic/ableist/etc. shit, I will very likely block you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed on a few occasions that people I like or don&amp;rsquo;t even know blocked me. I wondered to myself, &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;, and then let it be. They have a right to control their space on twitter. I am not entitled to interact with them. I recommend you deal with being blocked the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think I accidentally blocked you and are sad about this, feel free to email me about it. Otherwise, deal with it. You&amp;rsquo;re not entitled to interact with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="disclaimer"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts on twitter are my own and not those of my employer or other organizations I participate in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-to-engage-with-me"&gt;How to engage with me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing a lot of common points of confusion or frustration for people who try to engage with me on twitter. Here is some information that I hope will clear some of that up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I context switch a lot. It is to your benefit to follow me for a little while to get a sense of what those contexts look like. Alternatively, ask if I&amp;rsquo;m being serious or joking about something. Assumptions without context tend to end poorly. If you do not enjoy the varying ways I use twitter or the context switching, I suggest not following me. It sounds like my feed is not a good fit for how you use twitter, and that&amp;rsquo;s totally ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognize twitter is 140 characters. It is not a space that allows for nuance, proper grammar, or good explanations. Asking for clarification on something is often useful. If I&amp;rsquo;m doing a long string of tweets (as I am wont to do when in activist or educator mode), read the associated tweets in my timeline for additional information before engaging. My email is on my &lt;a href="/about"&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt; if you want longform communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read my &lt;a href="/blog/2013/11/02/101-off-limits/"&gt;101 off limits list&lt;/a&gt; before engaging with me. If you hit one of the points on there, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to point you to it anyway. Intentionally hitting the points in there knowing I have requested not to discuss them shows you do not respect boundaries. Don&amp;rsquo;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know that I have the right to end conversations or decline to engage in them. I do not always have the time or energy to educate or discuss. Asking to stop or declining to start is not rude. It is setting a boundary and asking you to respect it. I am not obligated to be constantly available to anyone. This is not my job, and nobody pays me to do it. I have a full-time job, groups I organize, and other things I want to spend my time on. When you get angry when I ask to stop, it sounds like you are angry that I have not prioritized &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; wants and needs over my own. Don&amp;rsquo;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless I say an absolute all/every/always/etc., it&amp;rsquo;s very unlikely I mean an absolute. As &lt;a href="http://rarlindseysmash.com/posts/stupid-programmer-tricks-and-star-wars-gifs"&gt;my Star Wars loving friend&lt;/a&gt; reminded me, only a Sith deals in absolutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="only-a-sith.gif" alt="only a sith deals in absolutes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion-(and-tldr)"&gt;Conclusion (and tldr)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a useful tool. I have a bunch of friends on there. I use twitter a lot of different ways. I use it how I like. Respect my boundaries, and enjoy twitter however you like besides that.&lt;/p&gt;
